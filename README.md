# This Is Not the Official Python Project Repository!

### Though it will be, some time fairly soon

You may have read announcements that Python developers have decided to move to git.
That hasn't happened yet.

## No Pull Requests, Please

At present the move to Github is still being planned, and so pull requests
to this repository will not be actioned. We try to inform people of this by responding to
pull requests, but the time spent doing that would really be better spent developing the
Python language!

This site is currently a mirror of Python's official repository, which lives
at https://hg.python.org/, updated daily as a service to those who are already using
Github and find it a more convenient distribution channel.

## Yes, Contributions Are Welcome

The official Python source code repository is currently implemented on Mercurial.
The Python Developers' Guide is at https://docs.python.org/devguide/, and it
explains all you need you know to join the Python developers. If you are
interested in contributring then we especially recommend that you read
https://docs.python.org/devguide/#contributing.

Thanks for taking time to visit the Python repository.
