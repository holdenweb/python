# WHOA! No Pull Requests, Please!

## This Isn't the Python Project Github Site!

## Though it will be, some time fairly soon

You may have read announcements that Python developers have decided to move to git.

That will happen, but at present the move is still being planned, and so pull requests
to this repository will not be actioned. We try to inform people of this by responding to
pull requests, but the time spent doing that wold really be better spent developing the
Python language!

## Yes, Contributions Are Welcome

The official Python repository is currently a Mercurial repository.
